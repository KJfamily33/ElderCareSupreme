      We have created this page to bring together people who would like help with chores and aides who can help out.<br>
      Have you reached an age when certain chores aren't as easy as they used to be? Would you like some help with these chores?<br>
      Maybe you don't have any problem doing chores, and you even have some time that you would like to spend helping an elderly?<br>
      Then you've found the right page!<br>
      <br>
      At the bottom of this page, there is a "register" button that you can use to create an account.<br>
      Or, if you've already got an account, you can use the "login" button.<br>
      Then, if you would like some help, you can take a look at the dashboard and add tasks you would like help with.<br>
      Otherwise, if you would like to help someone, you can take a look at possible chores and let people know you would like to help them.<br>
      <br>
      So, sign up or log in, and take a look around!
